This package implements the MEAM-BO potential as a LAMMPS pair style.

==============================================================================

This package is based on the MEAM/C package where bond order calculations are added.

The MEAM/C package is a translation by

The original MEAM Fortran implementation was created by
  Greg Wagner (while at Sandia, now at Northwestern U).

==============================================================================

Use "make yes-user-meambo" to enable this package when building LAMMPS.

In your LAMMPS input script, specify
  pair_style meambo
  pair_coeff * * parameter_1 el1 ... parameter_2 el1 ... bond_parameter_2
to enable the use of this implementation. The library and parameter files used
with pair_style meam/c are usable by pair_style meambo; however, the following
keyword=value lines, for example, are necessary for bond order calculation:
    ntypBC=1 		   // number of elements that have unsaturated bonds
	rcutBC(1)=3.3      // cutoff radius for 1st element for bond order calculation 
	rcutBC(2)=2.4      // cutoff radius for 2nd element for bond order calculation 
	vdW_form = 1       // selection parameter for form of vdW function
					   // 0: no vdW effect, 1: 9-6 Lenard Jones equation
	evdW_96LJ(1)=0.435 // epsilon (energy) parameter for 1st element in 9-6 LJ
	evdW_96LJ(2)=0     // epsilon (energy) parameter for 2nd element in 9-6 LJ 
	svdW_96LJ(1)=3.01  // sigma (distance) paramters for 1st element in 9-6 LJ 
	svdW_96LJ(2)=0     // sigma (distance) paramters for 2nd element in 9-6 LJ

  pair_coeff * * parameter_1 el1 ... parameter_2 el1 ... NULL
will execute the original MEAM calculation without bond order calculation 
so that the results will be exactly the same as those of meam/c.

Other differences compared with meam/c
1. New reference structures are added.
	a. ch4: methane-like structure only for binary system.
	b. dia3: diamond structure with primary 1NN and secondary 3NN inteation
    c. tri: H2O-like structure that has an angle
	e. zig: zigzag structure with a uniform angle 
    d. lin: linear structure (180 degree angle)
2. tri, zig, and lin reference structures require angle information (in degree) 
such as the following.
   theta = 109.5
   
The bond file contains the bond information, for example (Hydrocarbon):

# double bond: e2a_0(1:3), e2a_1(1:3), e2a_2(1:3), re2a(1:3)
# triple bond: eb3(1:3), re3
